<p>3,327,806 children in the country are child laborers working in various sectors like agriculture, industry and services. Children are also often forced to work in gold, wolframite, and coltan mines. They are hindered from going to school, and are also forcibly recruited into armed forces while attending schools. Sexual exploitation of children is also common. Inability to produce valid birth certificates and proof of citizenship sometimes leaves children with no choice but to enter the labor markets to make money for their poor families.</p>
