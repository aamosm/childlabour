<p>The world's second most populated country, India, has as many as 33 million child labourers. Children work in mines, on farms, and in garment factories. Although the economy of the country has grown over the past several decades, not everyone in the population has benefited evenly. Despite legislative efforts, the number of child workers has increased in recent years especially in big cities.</p>
