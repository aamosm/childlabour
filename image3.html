<p>Nearly 13% of Pakistani children accounting for 2,449,480 individuals between the ages of 10 to 14 are child labourers. 76% of these children work in the agricultural sector involving activities like working in crop fields, fishing and shrimp harvesting and processing. A large number of children are also engaged in restaurants, tea stalls, transportation, and garbage scavenging. As per ILO, poverty is the single major factor responsible for the high prevalence of child labor in the country.</p>
